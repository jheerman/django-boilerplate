# django web application boilerplate

## Getting Started

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

nginx (pronounced engine-x) is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

A web server faces the outside world. It can serve files (HTML, images, CSS, etc) directly from the file system. However, it canâ€™t talk directly to Django applications; it needs something that will run the application, feed it requests from web clients (such as browsers) and return responses.

A Web Server Gateway Interface - WSGI - does this job. WSGI is a Python standard.

uWSGI is a WSGI implementation. In this example we will set up uWSGI so that it creates a Unix socket, and serves responses to the web server via the uwsgi protocol. 

Make sure you are using a virtual environment of some sort (e.g. `virtualenv` or
`pyenv`).
